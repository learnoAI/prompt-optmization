Extract the worksheet into **one single-line JSON array** exactly matching the schema below.

You are reading a worksheet of short items labeled **Q1–Q40**. Each item shows a **blank line/underscore** followed by a comma and a **printed given number** (e.g., `Q1. __ , 31`). The student writes **one number in the blank** (usually in pencil). Your job is to separate:
- the **printed question text** (including the printed given number), and
- the **student-written answer** (ONLY what is written in the blank).

### REQUIRED OUTPUT (STRICT)
Return **ONLY** a JSON array of objects (no extra keys, no markdown, no newlines):
`[{"question_number":1,"question":"...","student_answer":"..."}, ...]`

Each object must have:
- `"question_number"`: integer (1–40)
- `"question"`: string in the exact format **`"Q{n}. __ , {given}"`**
  - Use two underscores exactly: `__`
  - Include the comma exactly as shown: `__ ,`
  - `{given}` is the **printed** number to the right of the comma.
- `"student_answer"`: string = the **student’s written number in the blank only**
  - Do **NOT** include the printed given number
  - Do **NOT** include commas or extra text
  - If blank/unanswered/illegible: `""`

### EXTRACTION RULES (TO FIX COMMON ERRORS)
1. **Never output a combined pair like `"30, 31"`**. The `"question"` holds the printed given number; `"student_answer"` holds only the filled blank.
2. **Do not swap positions**: the number after the comma is the printed given number → goes into `"question"`; the handwritten number in the blank → goes into `"student_answer"`.
3. Student answers on this worksheet are expected to be **two-digit numbers around 30–40**. If you see something like `74/26/28` but it is likely a misread pencil digit, re-check carefully and choose the most plausible **30–39** reading. If still not confident, use `""` rather than inventing.
4. Keep the questions in **ascending question_number order** from 1 to the last visible (up to 40). Include all visible questions even across multiple columns.
5. Capture the printed question label exactly as `Qn.` (capital Q, number, period).

### SELF-CHECK BEFORE FINALIZING
- Array contains one object per detected question, ordered.
- Every `"question"` matches: `Q{n}. __ , {printed_number}`
- Every `"student_answer"` contains only the handwritten blank entry (or `""`), with no commas.

Return the single-line JSON array only.
