Task: Extract every question and the student’s handwritten answer from the provided worksheet images and return a single-line JSON array that strictly follows the schema below. Do not add, remove, or reorder any characters in the captured question text. Do not translate or paraphrase anything.

Output schema (strict; use exactly these keys):
- question_number: integer (e.g., 1, 2, …)
- question: string (the printed per-question text only; copy verbatim)
- student_answer: string (exactly what the student wrote; if blank/unreadable, use "")

What to capture
- Identify each question by its printed label “Q<number>.” (e.g., Q1., Q2., …). Questions may appear in multiple columns; treat each “Q<number>.” as a separate item.
- The question line for this worksheet type is printed as a single line with a blank and a number after a comma (e.g., “Q7. __ , 37”). Copy this line exactly as printed for the question field:
  - Include the leading “Q<number>.” exactly.
  - Include the blank (“__”), commas, spaces, and the printed number exactly as shown on the page.
  - Do not include any headings, instructions, translations, or nearby text (e.g., “What comes before” or Hindi text). Only the per-question line itself goes into question.
  - Do not include the student’s handwriting in the question field.
- The student_answer is the number written by the student in the blank. Record exactly what is written:
  - Digits/signs only as written (e.g., “30”, “-2”, “39”). Do not compute or correct.
  - If the student left it blank or it’s truly unreadable after careful inspection, use "".
  - If there are erasures/overwrites, choose the darkest/most recent writing.
  - Do not add spaces or punctuation around the answer.

Handwriting and ambiguity rules
- Do not interpret or fix answers. Your job is transcription, not grading.
- If a mark could be reasonably read as one of two digits (e.g., 1 vs 7, 3 vs 8, 5 vs S), pick the more likely digit based on handwriting shape and context. As a tie-breaker only (when truly ambiguous), prefer the value consistent with the printed pattern of the worksheet (e.g., “__ , 31” commonly expects “30”). If the written mark remains too ambiguous, return "".
- Numbers must be captured as the student wrote them; do not normalize (e.g., keep “39” as “39”, not “39.0”).

Formatting normalization for question field (only to fix OCR misreads of the printed label)
- Ensure the question starts with “Q<number>.” using digits for <number> (e.g., correct common OCR confusions such as “Ql.”→“Q1.”, “QIO.”/“QlO.”→“Q10.”).
- Preserve all punctuation and spacing that appear on the printed per-question line, including spaces around the comma in “__ , <number>”. Do not add or remove characters, words, or newlines.

Detection and ordering
- Extract all questions present. Many sheets have up to 40 questions; include each one found. Do not invent missing questions.
- Sort by question_number ascending (Q1, Q2, …).
- Use the integer found in the printed label for question_number (e.g., “Q27.” → 27).

Quality checks before submitting
- You return a JSON array with one object per question found; if Q1–Q40 are present, there must be exactly 40 objects.
- Keys are exactly: question_number (int), question (str), student_answer (str). No extra keys.
- Each question string:
  - Begins with “Q<number>.” where <number> matches question_number.
  - Contains the blank and the printed number after the comma exactly as on the page (e.g., “Q22. __ , 35”).
  - Contains no student handwriting, headings, or translations.
  - Has no line breaks.
- Each student_answer string is exactly what the student wrote in the blank (or ""), with no added/removed characters.
- No duplicate question_numbers; numbers are consecutive where present.
- Double-check that you did not swap the printed number and the student’s answer.

Output format
- Return a single-line JSON array only (minified; no newlines, no indentation).
- Do not include code fences, comments, or any text before/after the JSON.
